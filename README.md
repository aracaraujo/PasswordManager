# Password Manager

This program is small program that I created while learning C++.

The program is a password manager that will allow you to create an account on the program and then allow you to store passwords.

The program also has a feature to generate passwords. The program uses the technique called Diceware which consist of rolling some dice 5 times, and then the 5-digit number is used against a lookup table of words. This process is repeated 6 times returning then 6 random words. Words easy enough to remember, yet with a high amount of entropy which will them generate a strong password.

The program also has a feature to let you enter your dice values in case you don’t trust on the random generator. The program will prompt you for your own values a then lookup against the table of words and return you the password. 

Diceware word list is a public list, and its content is available to all. Nevertheless, the high number of words and the high entropy that will come from picking random words will still generate a strong password. 

Feel free to download and run this in your machine. You can test the generate passwords in websites that test password strength to see for yourself. 

I’m still working on this program to refine some aspects of it, but feel free to reach out to me with any ideas or suggestions.
